# dreamnet-ircbot

An evening project, a collection of silly, useful and not-so-useful handlers to
aid nonsensical chatting in private channel with friends.

Supported handlers:
- when `kanthal` is too lazy to describe youtube videos he links, it queries
  google api for the video title
- random "That's what she said!" bursts, Michael Scott style

To be added:
- days since Trump was mentioned
- link store
