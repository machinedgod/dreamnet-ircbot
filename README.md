# dreamnet-ircbot

An evening project, a collection of silly, useful and not-so-useful handlers to
aid nonsensical chatting in private channel with friends.

Supported handlers:
- when `kanthal` is too lazy to describe youtube videos he links, it queries
  google api for the video title

To be added:
- days since Trump was mentioned
